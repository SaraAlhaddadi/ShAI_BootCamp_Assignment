This repository contains the code and analysis for the ShAI BootCamp assignment.
The assignment focuses on data exploration, descriptive statistics, data cleaning,
data visualization, grouped analysis, and simple correlation analysis. The tasks to be completed are as follows:

### 1. Basic Data Exploration
- Identify the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
- Determine the data types of each column.
- Check for missing values in each column.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics
- Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, minimum, and maximum salary.
- Determine the range of salaries.
- Find the standard deviation of the salary data.

### 3. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing data using a suitable method. Provide an explanation for the chosen method.

### 4. Basic Data Visualization
- Create histograms or bar charts to visualize the distribution of salaries.
- Use pie charts to represent the proportion of employees in different departments.

### 5. Grouped Analysis
- Group the data by one or more columns.
- Calculate summary statistics for each group.
- Compare the average salaries across different groups.

### 6. Simple Correlation Analysis
- Identify any correlation between salary and another numerical column.
